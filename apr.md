# Requirements

## Functional

### Loading files (POLSL-SE/whaaale#?)

**Description:** Enumerating available loaders, showing an "Open file" dialog, passing selected file to a relevant loader and catching loader exceptions.

**Result:** Replace image data object in the memory with data returned from loader.

**Side effects:** Switch display mode to monochromatic and first band.

#### MATLAB file loader

A loader which accepts `.mat` files, returns the only three-dimensional variable from such file or one selected by user from a list, if there are multiple such variables.

#### ENVI file loader

A loader accepting ENVI files with headers. Reports compatibility with `.hdr` files. Requires a file with the same name and no `.hdr` extension in the same directory as header. Returns a three-dimensional array with data and if possible wavelength labels for all bands.

> **Note**
> These are the files in AVIRIS datasets

## Non-functional

### Performance

??? (hard to estimate without a prototype)

### Portability

Program must be available for Linux and Windows. It must be possible to run the program without installing it. Program should be distributed as a ZIP archive.\
If possible without developer's license and code signing certificate, the program should be available for macOS.

### Usability

All buttons with icons must have a label visible after hovering them with a mouse cursor.

### Reliability

All errors during file I/O (loading images, exporting curves) must be caught and displayed in a dialog box.

### Code organisation

Code must adhere to the following criteria:

#### Text file format

All text files must be UTF-8 encoded and saved with LF line endings.

#### Python source style

Source code files in Python must be formatted with black.
